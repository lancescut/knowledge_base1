      "description": "Create a responsive web frontend using Vite, React, and TypeScript that integrates with the existing FastAPI backend for the Technical Knowledge Base RAG System.",
      "details": "Implement a modern Gemini-style UI that includes the following features: (1) A PDF upload panel for users to upload documents; (2) A dedicated page that lists vectorized chunks after processing, displaying metadata and allowing users to navigate through chunks; (3) A chat interface that enables users to ask questions about the uploaded documents, utilizing the integrated Qwen generation model; (4) A toggle for dark/light themes to enhance user experience; (5) Ensure the application is dockerized for production deployment. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessible components. Ensure that the frontend communicates effectively with the FastAPI endpoints for PDF processing and chat functionalities.",
      "testStrategy": "Verify the frontend by performing the following tests: (1) Ensure the PDF upload panel correctly uploads files and displays success/error messages; (2) Check that the vectorized chunks page displays processed chunks accurately with correct metadata; (3) Test the chat interface by asking questions and verifying that responses are generated correctly; (4) Validate the dark/light theme toggle functionality; (5) Confirm that the application builds successfully in a Docker environment and is accessible in production.",
