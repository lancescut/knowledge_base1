# Overview  
The project aims to engineer a highly accurate, responsive, and user-friendly knowledge base system for interacting with complex technical PDF documents. This system will function as an intelligent assistant for engineers, researchers, and technical staff, enabling them to query dense documentation using natural language and receive precise, context-aware answers.

The primary goal is to develop a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that leverages state-of-the-art open-source components to deliver a seamless and trustworthy question-answering experience.

# Core Features  
## Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Robust PDF parsing capable of handling structural complexity of technical documents
- Advanced, context-aware chunking strategy tailored for technical content
- Asynchronous processing with task queue management
- Metadata enrichment for source attribution and filtering

## RAG Backend System
- Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B embedding model for high-quality text representations
- Vector database with dual-environment support (Milvus for production, Chroma for development)
- Multi-stage retrieval pipeline with reranking for precision
- Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct generation model for final answer synthesis

## Web Application Interface
- React/Next.js frontend with Gemini-like chat interface
- Real-time streaming responses
- Session management and searchable chat history
- Source attribution and verification features
- Mobile-responsive design

## Enterprise Features
- RESTful API with clear endpoint specifications
- Containerized microservices architecture
- Kubernetes deployment for production scalability
- Authentication and security compliance

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Engineers and researchers working with technical documentation
- Technical staff requiring quick access to complex PDF content
- Enterprise users needing verifiable, source-attributed answers

## Key User Flows
- Upload PDF documents through web interface
- Ask natural language questions about document content
- Receive streaming responses with source citations
- Browse and search conversation history
- Verify answers by accessing original document sources

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, minimalist design modeled after Google Gemini
- Improved usability with searchable history (addressing Gemini's known issues)
- Rich content display with Markdown, LaTeX, and code highlighting
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
